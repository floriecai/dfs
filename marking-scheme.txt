Total mark: [0/100]
---------------------------------------------------

Late penalty: 0

Connected operation [0/100]
* Simple open: Client mounts DFS, opens a file, closes it, and then unmounts DFS [0/100]
* Simple read: Client mounts DFS, opens a file, reads it, closes it, and then unmounts DFS [0/100]
* Simple write: Client mounts DFS, opens a file, writes to it, reads it, closes it, and then unmounts DFS. [0/100]
* Simple LocalFileExists: Client mounts DFS, opens a file, closes it, calls LocalFileExists on the file name, and then unmounts DFS [0/100]
* Simple GlobalFileExists: Client mounts DFS, opens a file, closes it, calls GlobalFileExists on the file name, and then unmounts DFS [0/100]
* Single client: Client A mounts DFS, opens an invalid file, opens a valid file, reads it, writes it, reads the content back, closes it, and unmounts DFS; client B mounts DFS, calls GlobalFileExists on the file name, cals LocalFileExists on the file name, opens the file, and then unmounts DFS [0/100]
* One client is able to observe writes from another client (single write operation) [0/100]
* One client is able to observe writes from another client (double write operation) [0/100]
* Handling multiple clients attempting to open a file for writing [0/100]
* Multiple reader clients and one writer client; One client opens for writing, other clients check global file exists [0/100]
* Multiple reader clients and one writer client; One client opens for writing, other clients open for reading. First client performs three writes, other clients read after each write. [0/100]
* Multiple reader clients and one writer client; First client writes file, other clients read the changes, first client closes the file. Repeated for each client [0/100]

Disconnected operation [0/100]
* Client writes file, disconnects; can use DREAD while disconnected [0/100]
* Client writes file, disconnects; can LocalFileExists while disconnected [0/100]
* Unobservable transitory disconnections [0/100]
* Client A opens file F for writing, disconnects. Client B connects and opens F for writing, succeeds [0/100]
* Client B opens file. Client A writes/closes file, disconnects. Client B writes file. Client A re-connects, reads, observes B changes [0/100]
* Client A writes file. Client B opens file. Client A writes file, disconnects. Client B observe changes [0/100]
* Multiple reader clients and one writer client; A opens, A writes, B opens, A disconnects, C opens, C reads [0/100]
* Multiple reader clients and one writer client; client A opens, B opens, A writes, B reads, A disconnects, C opens, C reads [0/100]
* Multiple reader clients and one writer client; client A opens, A writes, A closes, B opens, A disconnects, B reads, B writes, B closes, C opens, B disconnects, C reads, C writes, C closes [0/100]
